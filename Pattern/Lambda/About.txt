1.What are Pyhon Lambda Functiins?
 Python Lambda Functions are:
  ⁎ Anonymous or nameless functions
  ⁎ 'Lambda' is not a name, but its a keyword
  
2.Why are they used?
  One-time use: Also known as throw-away functions as they are needed just once.
  I/O of other functions: They are also passed as input or returned as output of other higher-order functiins.
  Reduce code size: The body of Lambda functions is written in a single line.
  
3.How to write Anonymous functions?
  A Lambda function is created using the lambda operator
  Syntax:
    lambda arguments: expression
    lambda: "Specify the purpose"
    lambda a₁: "Specify use of a₁"
