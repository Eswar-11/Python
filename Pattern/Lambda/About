1.What are Pyhon Lambda Functiins?
 Python Lambda Functions are:
  ⁎ Anonymous or nameless functions
  ⁎ 'Lambda' is not a name, but its a keyword
  
2.Why are they used?
  One-time use: Also known as throw-away functions as they are needed just once.
  I/O of other functions: They are also passed as input or returned as output of other higher-order functions.
  Reduce code size: The body of Lambda functions is written in a single line.
  
3.How to write Anonymous functions?
  A Lambda function is created using the lambda operator
  Syntax:
    lambda arguments: expression
    lambda: "Specify the purpose"
    lambda a₁: "Specify use of a₁"

4.Anonymous functions within user defined functions
  Lambda functions are best used within other higher-order functions

5.Using Lambda functions within filter(), map(), reduce()
  filter(): Used to filter the given iterables(lists, sets, etc) with the help of another function passed as an argument to test all the elements to be true or false.
  map(): Applies a given function to all the iterables and returns a new list.
  reduce(): Applies some other function to a list of elements that are passed as a parameter to it and finally returns a single value.
