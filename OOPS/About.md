1. Classes and Objects

2. Classes in Python
   * A class is the blueprint from which specific objects are created.
     
| Class Variable | Instance Variable | Data Member |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. | Instance variable unique to each instance | A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects. |

3. OOPS Concept in Python
   1. Inheritance:
       * A class can inherit attributes and behavior methods from another class, called the superclass.
       * A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class.
    
   2. Encapsulation:
       * Binding the data ans code together as a single unit.
       * Securing data by hiding the implementation details to user.
     
   3. Abstraction:
       * Hides the implementation details and only provides the functionality to the user.
       * You can achieve abstraction using Abstract classes and Interfaces.
       * Abstract Class cannot be instantiated.
       * It can only be inherited. 

4. Inheritance in Python
    * __init__() Function: __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is used to create an object.

5. Types of Inheritance
    * Single: When the inheritance involves one child class and one parent class.
    * Multiple: It involves more than one parent class.
    * Multilevel: The child class acts as a parent class for another child class.
    * Hierarchical: More than one type of inheritance.
