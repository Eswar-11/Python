1. Seaborn library:
    * Used for data visualization & based on Matplatlib
    * Seaborn allows the creation of statistical graphics

2. Functionalities:
    * Allows comparison between multiple variables 
    * Supports multi-plot grids
    * Available univariate and bivariate visualizations
    * Availability of different colour palettes
    * Estimates and plats linear regression automatically

3. Seaborn vs Matplotlib
    * Seaborn fixes two shortcomings of Matplotlib:
       * Matplotlib settings are difficult to figure out, Seaborn comes with numerous customized themes and high-level interfaces.
       * Matplatlib doesn't serve well when it comes to dealing with DataFrames, while Seaborn functions actually work on DataFrames.

4. Python Seaborn Functions
    * Visualizing Statistical Relationships
       * Process of understanding relationships between variables of a dataset
    * Plotting with Categorical Data
       * Main variable is further divided into discrete groups
    * Visualizing the distribution of a dataset
       * Understanding datasets with context to being univariate or bivariate

5. Multi-Plot Grids
    * Graphs are plotted side-by-side using the same scale and axes to aid comparison

6. Plot- Aesthetics
    * Deals with making our plots more attractive and delightful using various themes and color-pallettes.
