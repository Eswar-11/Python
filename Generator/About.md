1.What are Generators?\
__⁕ Are functions that return traversable objects\
__⁕ Produce items one at a time and only when required\
__⁕ Are run along with 'for' loops
  
2.Advantages of using Generators
  ⁕ Easy to Implement.
  ⁕ Better memory management and utilization.
  ⁕ Can be used to produce infinite items.
  ⁕ Can also be used to pipeline a number of operations.
  
3.Normal functions vs Generators
  | Generator function  |  Normal Functions  |
  | ------------------- | ------------------ |
  | Make use of ‘yield’ keyword | Make use of ‘return’ keyword |
  

4.Writing Generators in Python
  ⁕ Generators created using the ‘def’ keyword
  ⁕ Make use of the yield keyword instead of return

5.Generators with Loops
  ⁕ To execute the generator function at once. You can ‘for’ loop. This loop iterates over all the objects and after all implementations, it executes StopIteration.

6.Generator Expressions
  ⁕ Resemble list comprehensions and like lambda functions, generator expressions create anonymous generator functions.

7.Use Cases
  ⁕ Fibonacci Series: A series of numbers where in each number also called as the Fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
  ⁕ Number Stream: Generating a stream of numbers.
  ⁕ Sinewave: Generating sine waves using Seaborn.
