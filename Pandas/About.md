   * Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
       * Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns.
       * Ordered and unordered time series data.
       * Arbitrary matrix data with row and column labels
       * Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure
