1. What is Pandas?
   * Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

2. Data Analysis Using Python
   * Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
       * Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns.
       * Ordered and unordered time series data.
       * Arbitrary matrix data with row and column labels
       * Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure 

3. Python For Statistics
   * Mean:
      * from statistics import mean
      * print(mean([1,1,1,1,3,4,4,4,5,2]))
   * Mode:
      * from statistics import mode
      * print(mode([1,1,1,1,3,4,4,4,5,2])) 
   * Median:
      * from statistics import median
      * print(median([1,1,1,1,3,4,4,4,5,2]))
   * Variance:
      * from statistics import variance
      * print(variance([1,1,1,1,3,4,4,4,5,2]))
      
4. Python For Hadoop : Pydoop
    * Pydoop is a Python interface to Hadoop that allows you to write MapReduce applications and interact with HDFS in pure Python.
